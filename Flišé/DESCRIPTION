This is a product project we worked on as a team. 
Flišé is a lamp that contains a hologram of a fish (other animals, plants, etc. are also possible). 
We researched stakeholders, their desires and needs using techniques such as stakeholder mapping, 
surveys and personal interviews, Personas, Avting Mapping Canvas, and How Might We. 
The drawings and logo were created by me.
